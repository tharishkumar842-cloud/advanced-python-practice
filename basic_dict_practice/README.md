Basic Dictionary Practice in Python
This repository contains my basic Python dictionary practice.
I practiced using dictionaries through 8 different files.

In this repo, I learned and practiced:

copy() and update() methods
get() and items()
pop() and popitem()
Using for loop with keys and values
Finding the highest mark from a dictionary
This practice helped me understand how dictionaries work in Python and improved my basics.

Files Included
🔹 dict_merging.py

Demonstrates how to merge two dictionaries

Uses copy() to avoid modifying the original dictionary

Uses update() to combine values from another dictionary

🔹 dict_practice.1.py

This file covers many basic dictionary operations, such as:

Duplicate keys (latest value overrides old one)

Accessing values using keys

Using get() with a default value

Printing keys(), values(), and items()

Looping through dictionary using for

Adding elements using update()

Removing elements using pop() and popitem()

🔹 dict_practice.2.py

Uses update() to modify or add values in an existing dictionary

🔹 dict_practice.3.py

Uses pop() to delete a specific key-value pair from the dictionary

🔹 dict_practice.4.py

Checks if a key is NOT present in a dictionary using if "key" not in dict

🔹 dict_practice.5.py

Uses dictionary comprehension

Counts how many keys have the value 18 in the dictionary

🔹 dict_practice.6.py

Uses max() to find the maximum value in a dictionary

Uses a for loop to print the corresponding key and value

🔹 fromkeys.py

Uses fromkeys() to create a dictionary

All keys are assigned the value None
