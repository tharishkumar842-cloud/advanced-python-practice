 🐍 Dict Comprehension Practice

This repository contains Python practice files focusing on dictionary comprehensions.

---

## Topics Covered
- Dictionary transformation
- Conditional filtering using dict comprehension
- Nested dictionaries
- Mathematical operations with values
- Real-world style examples (salary update, number properties)

## Practice Files

- **dict_comprehension_practice1** → Transform dictionary keys to lowercase and string values to uppercase, while ignoring non-string values

- **dict_comprehension_practice2** → key_value is incremented by 20 if key is notebook

- **dict_comprehension_practice3 & dict_comprehension_practice4** → All the key value pairs are accessed and printed based on the conditions v>2 and v>=50

- **dict_comprehension_practice5** → key_value is transformed into v+v*0.1 if its satisfies the condition v<50000  
  Update salaries by 10% if less than 50,000

- **dict_comprehension_practice6.py** → Even numbers are getting transformed into their squares

- **dict_comprehension_practice7.py** → Creates a dictionary for numbers 1–10 where each key maps to another dictionary containing:  
  "square" → the square of the number  
  "cube" → the cube of the number

- **dict_comprehension_practice8.py** → Creates a dictionary for even numbers from 1 to 10, where each key maps to another dictionary containing:  
  "square" → the square of the number  
  "cube" → the cube of the number  
  "is_multiple_of_4" → True if the number is a multiple of 4, else False
