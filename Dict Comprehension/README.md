Dict Comprehension Practice
This repository contains Python practice files focusing on dictionary comprehensions.
The files included are:
dict_practice1 :This Python code demonstrates how to transform dictionary keys to lowercase and string values to uppercase, while ignoring non-string values.

dict_practice2 :In this python code ,key_value is incremented by 20 if key is notebook

dict_practice 3 & 4:All the key value pairs are accessed and printed based on the conditions v>2 and v>=50

dict_practice 5:key_value is transformed into v+v*0.1 if its satisfies the condition v<50000


dict_comprehension_practice5.py – Update salaries by 10% if less than 50,000
dict_comprehension_practice6.py – Even numbers are getting transformed into their squares
dict_comprehension_practice7.py – – Creates a dictionary for numbers 1–10 where each key maps to another dictionary containing:
"square" → the square of the number
"cube" → the cube of the number
– Creates a dictionary for numbers 1–10 where each key maps to another dictionary containing: - "square" → the square of the number - "cube" → the cube of the number

dict_comprehension_practice8.py – Creates a dictionary for even numbers from 1 to 10, where each key maps to another dictionary containing:
"square" → the square of the number
"cube" → the cube of the number
"is_multiple_of_4" → True if the number is a multiple of 4, else `False
