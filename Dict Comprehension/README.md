## Practice Files

- **dict_comprehension_practice1** → Transform dictionary keys to lowercase and string values to uppercase, while ignoring non-string values

- **dict_comprehension_practice2** → key_value is incremented by 20 if key is notebook

- **dict_comprehension_practice3 & dict_comprehension_practice4** → All the key value pairs are accessed and printed based on the conditions v>2 and v>=50

- **dict_comprehension_practice5** → key_value is transformed into v+v*0.1 if its satisfies the condition v<50000  
  Update salaries by 10% if less than 50,000

- **dict_comprehension_practice6.py** → Even numbers are getting transformed into their squares
