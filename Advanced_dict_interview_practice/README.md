# 🐍 Python List & Dictionary Practice

This repository contains Python programs focused on list and dictionary operations, designed for logic building and interview preparation.

---

## Topics Covered
- List comprehension
- Dictionary comprehension
- Conditional logic
- Student marks analysis
- Aggregation using built-in functions

## Practice Codes

### Code 1: Merging of two dictionaries
This program used to merge the two dictionaries without duplicates 


---

### Code 2: Highest Mark Finder
This program stores student marks in a dictionary.  
It finds the highest mark using max() and prints the student name.

---

### Code 3: Word Frequency Counter
This program counts how many times each word appears in a list.  
The result is stored in a dictionary as word–count pairs.

---

### Code 4: Total and Average Marks
This program calculates the total marks from a dictionary.  
It finds the number of students and computes the average.  
It uses sum() and len() functions.

---

### Code 5: Above Average Students
This program finds students who scored above the average marks.  
it uses dictionary comprehension with a condition.  
Only above-average students are stored in a new dictionary.

---

### Code 6: Total, Average & Top Student (Detailed)
This program takes a list of (student, marks) tuples.  
If a student appears multiple times, their marks are added together.  
The program calculates the overall average score.  
Students scoring above the average are stored separately.  
Finally, the student with the highest total marks is printed.

---

### Code 7: Student Average and Top Performer
Each student has a list of marks stored in a dictionary.  
Students with no marks are skipped using a condition.  
The average marks for each student are calculated.  
Students with average marks ≥ 85 are selected.  
The top student with the highest average is displayed.

## Notes
- Written using pure Python
- Beginner-friendly and logic-focused
- Strong foundation for interviews
- Useful for **DSA, Python, and AI/ML preparation**
