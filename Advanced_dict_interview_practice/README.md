Code1:This program checks each number in a list.
      If the number is divisible by 3, it replaces it with "THREE".
      It uses list comprehension for short and clean code.
code2:This program stores student marks in a dictionary.
      It finds the highest mark using max() and prints the student name.
code3:This program counts how many times each word appears in a list.
      The result is stored in a dictionary as word–count pairs.
code4:This program calculates the total marks from a dictionary.
      It finds the number of students and computes the average.
      It uses sum() and len() functions.
code5:This program finds students who scored above the average marks.
      it uses dictionary comprehension with a condition.
      Only above-average students are stored in a new dictionary.
Code 6: Total, Average & Top Student (Detailed)
         This program takes a list of (student, marks) tuples.
         If a student appears multiple times, their marks are added together.
         The program calculates the overall average score.
         Students scoring above the average are stored separately.
         Finally, the student with the highest total marks is printed.
code 7:Each student has a list of marks stored in a dictionary.
       Students with no marks are skipped using a condition.
       The average marks for each student are calculated.
       Students with average marks ≥ 85 are selected.
       The top student with the highest average is displayed.
